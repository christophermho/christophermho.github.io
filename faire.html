        that connects independent retailers with small brands—it makes it easy
        for retailers to discover, purchase, and stock unique products for their
        stores, while providing brands with a platform to reach a broader
        audience without the need for a traditional sales force.
      </div>
      <div class="content-text-last web-thin">
        At Faire, cross-functional teams are grouped into pillars, which are
        further divided into pods. I was part of the Support Experience pod,
        under the Retailer Tools & Programs pillar. The mission of our pod was
        to help customers with prompt and cost efficient support, and revamping
        Faire’s Help Center was the main project I worked on during my
        internship.
      </div>
      <div class="content-title font-bold web-thin">Motivation</div>
      <div class="content-text web-thin">
        The Support Experience pod had a roadmap for several projects to be
        shipped by the end of H2 2024. Our P0 was an AI support chatbot, while
        other priorities included a Help Center content audit, support issue
        taxonomy refresh, and improving and standardizing CSAT collection. With
        so many upcoming updates to Faire’s support ecosystem, it felt
        appropriate to update the Help Center as well, especially since its last
        update was in 2020 (4+ years ago).
      </div>
      <div class="content-text-last web-thin">
        Improving the Help Center could be meaningful not just from a UI/UX
        standpoint, but also as a lever for reducing Contact Rate (CR%) upstream
        of the self-serve tree. The Help Center is effective at deflecting a
        portion of tickets today—among users that visit, those who engage (i.e.
        search, read articles, navigate past user hubs) are 30-65% less likely
        to enter the self-serve flow and 15-25% less likely to create a
        self-serve ticket. However, there is also room for improvement—for
        instance, 30% who tried to search or navigate still initiated the
        self-serve flow.
      </div>
      <div class="content-title font-bold web-thin">Current State</div>
      <div class="content-text web-thin">
        Today, the Help Center starts on a parent page, where users must select
        between the Retailer hub or Brand hub—each has content scoped to the
        specific needs and interests of its audience. Once a user arrives at one
        of the hubs, they can search, browse by topic, read articles, or enter
        the self-serve flow through the ‘Contact Us’ button(s) located in the
        header and sidebar.

      <div class="content-title font-bold web-thin">UX Audit</div>
      <div class="content-text web-thin">
        To figure out what was and wasn’t working with the current help center,
        I conducted a UX audit for both the desktop and mobile experiences.
      </div>
      <img class="content-img" src="img/current-state-audit.png" />
      <ul class="content-text-last content-highlight-faire web-thin">
        <span class="bold color-faire">Key Insights</span>
        <li class="bullet-point">
          The hub pages lack strong visual hierarchy—no particular element
          stands out as headings, images, buttons, and text all blend together
          without clear distinction, providing users with no clear direction
        </li>
        <li class="bullet-point">
          Across the entire help center, top of page search and navigation
          elements (header & breadcrumb nav) feel clunky and unintuitive,
          especially on mobile where the UI becomes cramped
        </li>
        <li class="bullet-point">
          There is redundancy and excessive use of space on the search results
          and topic pages, particularly with article snippets, ‘Read more’
          links, and dividers for every article component
        </li>
      </ul>
      <div class="content-title font-bold web-thin">Competitive Analysis</div>
      <div class="content-text web-thin">
        The next step was to figure out best practices when designing a help
        center. I reviewed several help centers from well-established companies,
        as well as from Faire's competitors (i.e. other marketplaces). I focused
        on identifying key elements displaying intuitive navigation, clear
        categorization, and effective search functionality. Top examples I
        referred to included Airbnb, Slack, Coinbase, Uber, and Etsy.
      </div>

      <ul class="content-text-last content-highlight-faire web-thin">
        <span class="bold color-faire">Key Insights</span>
        <li class="bullet-point">
          No examples used a parent hub. Instead, platforms with multiple user
          types, like Airbnb and Etsy, started users on the relevant side while
          offering simple role switching for a seamless transition
        </li>
        <li class="bullet-point">
          Many home or hub pages prominently feature a large, central search bar
          (and related common topics) as a clear CTA, guiding users to find
          relevant information quickly
        </li>
        <li class="bullet-point">
          Many examples highlight search keywords in titles and snippets in the
          search results page, making it easier for users to find relevant
          content
        </li>
      </ul>
      <div class="content-title font-bold web-thin">Ideation</div>
      <div class="content-text web-thin">
        Taking the UX research into account, as well as reviewing Faire’s design
        system for ideal components, I approached the ideation phase broadly,
        exploring a variety of possibilities to improve the Help Center
        experience. This included experimenting with layouts for the home/hub,
        search results, topic, and article pages, as well as designing
        individual components and refining key navigation components, such as
        the header and breadcrumb nav. My goal was to address the pain points
        identified in the research and to align the designs with industry best
        practices to create a more intuitive and user-friendly experience.
      </div>
      <img class="content-img" src="img/faire-card-mockup.png" />
      <div class="content-text-last web-thin">
        To refine potential designs, I frequently collaborated with CX,
        engineering, strategy & analytics, brand design, and product designers
        in the RTP pillar, engaging in regular jam and feedback sessions. With a
        wide range of explorations, I will focus on the final design outcomes
        and the key decisions behind them.
      </div>
      <div class="content-title font-bold web-thin">Hub pages</div>
      <div class="content-text web-thin">
        To speed up visit duration, we removed the parent hub and now direct
        unsigned-in users to the Retailer hub—the Retailer side was chosen as
        the default since there are significantly more retailers than brands
        (~700k vs. ~150k). Important to note that signed-in users will always
        default to the hub most relevant to them. We also added a hub
        switcher/toggle at the top of the hero banner for a seamless transition
        between the Retailer and Brand hubs, since there is no longer a parent
        hub to complete this action. On non-hub pages, switching between the
        Retailer and Brand sides is accessed through the chevron located in the
        header.
      </div>
      <img class="content-img" src="img/hc-hub-pages.png" />
      <div class="content-text-last web-thin">
        <div class="content-text web-thin">
          Another major change was creating a greater focus on search as the
          primary CTA—this was done by centering and enlarging the search bar,
          and by adding a greeting (personalized for signed-in users) just
          above. Regarding the hero banner colors, we consulted with our brand
          studio team to figure out the best combination. We wanted to use more
          vibrant colors to generate energy, while at the same time staying
          within the in-product color palette, especially since the Help Center
          is a functional surface—which is how we decided on the light orange
          and purple for the Retailer and Brand sides respectively. The final
          update was a small QoL improvement: adding topic tags to the articles
          displayed in the Featured Guides section to enhance clarity, and
          standardizing previously inconsistent hover states for articles.

        Header & breadcrumb nav

      <div class="content-text web-thin">
        The breadcrumb navigation is present on every page, which feels
        unnecessary, especially on hub pages where users haven't navigated
        anywhere yet. Some breadcrumbs, like a ‘Search’ breadcrumb on the search
        results page, seem redundant since search is a global function rather
        than part of a linear navigation. The header is static, looking sparse
        on desktop but overcrowded on mobile. We’ve updated the header by
        replacing the Faire logo with a lockup that helps users understand their
        location within the Faire ecosystem and the Help Center. We also added a
        language selector and sign-in buttons so users don’t need to navigate
        back to other portals for these actions. The header now adjusts based on
        the user's location—whether they’re on the Retailer or Brand side, the
        type of page, their scroll depth, and their sign-in status. We
        simplified the breadcrumb navigation and removed it from some pages to
        improve clarity.
