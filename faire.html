      <div class="content-text-last web-thin">
        At Faire, cross-functional teams are grouped into pillars, which are
        further divided into pods. I was part of the Support Experience pod,
        under the Retailer Tools & Programs pillar. The mission of our pod was
        to help customers with prompt and cost efficient support, and revamping
        Faire’s Help Center was the main project I worked on during my
        internship.
      </div>
      <div class="content-title font-bold web-thin">Motivation</div>
      <div class="content-text web-thin">
        With several projects on the Support Experience pod’s roadmap for H2
        2024, all planned to be shipped by the end of the year, our top priority
        (P0) was an AI support chatbot. Other key initiatives included a Help
        Center content audit, a refresh of the support issue taxonomy, and the
        standardization and improvement of CSAT collection. Given these upcoming
        updates to Faire’s support ecosystem, updating the Help Center was
        essential, especially since its last overhaul was over 4 years ago
        (2020).
      </div>
      <div class="content-text-last web-thin">
        Improving the Help Center would be meaningful not just from a UI/UX
        standpoint, but also serve as a strategic lever to reduce Contact Rate
        (CR%) upstream of the self-serve tree. The Help Center already deflects
        a significant portion of tickets—users who engage (e.g., search, read
        articles, navigate beyond user hubs) are 30-65% less likely to enter the
        self-serve flow and 15-25% less likely to create a self-serve ticket.
        However, there’s still room for improvement—30% of users who attempt to
        search or navigate still end up initiating the self-serve flow.
      </div>
      <div class="content-title font-bold web-thin">Current State</div>
      <div class="content-text web-thin">
        Today, the Help Center starts on a parent page, where users must select
        between the Retailer hub or Brand hub—each has content scoped to the
        specific needs and interests of its audience. Once a user arrives at one
        of the hubs, they can search, browse by topic, read articles, or enter
        the self-serve flow through the ‘Contact Us’ buttons located in the
        header and sidebar.

      <div class="content-text-img web-thin">
        To figure out what was and wasn’t working with our current Help Center,
        I conducted a UX audit for both the desktop and mobile experiences.

          The user hubs lack a strong visual hierarchy—headings, images,

        </div>
        <div class="content-text content-one-highlight-faire">
          Across the Help Center, the top-of-page navigation elements (header &
          breadcrumb nav) feel clunky and unintuitive, especially on mobile
          where the UI feels cramped
        </div>
        <div class="content-text content-one-highlight-faire">
          There is redundancy and excessive use of space on the search results

      <div class="content-title font-bold web-thin">Competitive Analysis</div>
      <div class="content-text-img web-thin">
        The next step was to figure out best practices when designing a help
        center. I reviewed several help centers from well-established companies,
        as well as from Faire's competitors (i.e. other marketplaces). I focused
        on identifying key elements displaying intuitive navigation, clear
        categorization, and effective search functionality. Top examples I
        referred to included Airbnb, Slack, Coinbase, Uber, and Etsy.

          No examples use a parent hub—instead, platforms with multiple user
          types, like Airbnb and Etsy, start users on the relevant side with
          easy role switching for smooth transitions
        </div>
        <div class="content-text content-one-highlight-faire">
          Most home pages feature a prominent central search bar (and common

        </div>
        <div class="content-text content-one-highlight-faire">
          Many search results pages highlight query keywords in article titles

      <div class="content-title font-bold web-thin">Ideation</div>
      <div class="content-text-img web-thin">
        Building on the UX research and reviewing Faire’s design system for
        optimal components, I took a broad approach to ideation, exploring
        various possibilities to enhance our Help Center experience. This
        involved experimenting with layouts for the home/hub, search results,
        topic, and article pages, as well as designing individual components and
        refining key navigation elements like the header and breadcrumb nav. My
        goal was to address the pain points uncovered in the research while
        aligning the designs with industry best practices to create a more
        intuitive and user-friendly experience.

        To refine potential designs, I frequently collaborated with CX,
        engineering, strategy & analytics, brand studio, and product designers
        in the RTP pillar, engaging in regular jam and feedback sessions. With a
        wide range of explorations, I will focus on the final design outcomes
        and the key decisions behind them.

        Retailer and Brand hubs + removal of parent hub
      </div>
      <div class="content-text web-thin">
        To shorten visit durations, I removed the parent hub and now direct
        unsigned-in users to the Retailer hub, as it has a significantly larger
        user base (~700k retailers compared to ~150k brands). Signed-in users
        will always default to the hub most relevant to them. I also added a hub
        switcher/toggle at the top of the hero banner for a seamless transition
        between the Retailer and Brand hubs, since the parent hub is no longer
        available to complete this action. On non-hub pages, users can switch
        between the Retailer and Brand sides using the chevron in the header.
        Another major change was placing greater emphasis on search as the
        primary CTA. This was achieved by centering and enlarging the search bar
        and adding a greeting (personalized for signed-in users).
      </div>
      <img class="content-img" src="img/hc-hub-pages.png" />
      <div class="content-text web-thin">
        For the hero banner colors, I collaborated with our brand studio team to
        determine the best combination, aiming to incorporate brighter colors
        into the Help Center to create a sense of energy. Since the Help Center
        is a functional surface, we chose light orange and purple gradients for
        the Retailer and Brand sides respectively, ensuring they were visually
        engaging while aligned with Faire's in-product color palette. Lastly, I
        implemented several small quality-of-life improvements to the displayed
        articles: adding topic tags, editing fonts for enhanced clarity, and
        standardizing previously inconsistent hover states.

        Search results dropdown + common topics
      </div>
      <div class="content-text web-thin">
        In the current state, the search results dropdown used excessive space
        by including out-of-context article snippets that highlighted keywords
        from the user’s query. These snippets often started mid-sentence,
        providing little to no useful context. Additionally, the dropdown
        featured a scroll function that displayed every result, which felt
        redundant since users could simply press 'enter' to see all results on a
        larger screen view (search results page). In my redesign, I focused on
        enhancing scannability by removing article snippets and instead
        highlighting keywords within the actual article titles. The dropdown now
        displays a maximum of six suggestions, along with a "See all results"
        button that allows users to easily view the full list and prevents
        unnecessary scrolling.
      </div>
      <img class="content-img" src="img/hc-search-dropdown.png" />
      <div class="content-text web-thin">
        To further improve navigation, I introduced common topics just below the
        search bar, providing quick links to curated articles. These articles
        were specifically tailored for the Retailer and Brand hubs, selected by
        analyzing a mix of the most popular and highest-rated content based on
        CSAT scores. However, certain articles were intentionally excluded to
        protect the Faire brand. For instance, while "Issue with my order
        payout" was a popular topic, featuring it could discourage new users by
        raising concerns about Faire's reliability as a platform.

      <div class="content-text web-thin">
        In the current state, the header is static and minimal, displaying only
        the Faire logo, the "Contact Us" button, and a search bar on non-hub
        pages. I improved the header by adding a divider and the text "Help
        Center for Retailers/Brands" next to the Faire logo, providing users
        with a clear understanding of their location within the Faire
        ecosystem—this lockup is particularly important to prevent confusion for
        users who arrive via SEO. Additionally, I added a language selector and
        sign-in buttons, allowing users to perform these actions without needing
        to return to the Retailer or Brand portals.
      </div>
      <img class="content-img" src="img/header-desktop.png" />
      <div class="content-text web-thin">
        Additionally, the header is now fixed to the top and dynamically adjusts
        based on the user's location in the Help Center—the type of page, scroll
        depth, and sign-in status all affect which components appear in the
        header. For example, scrolling past the primary search bar on hub pages
        reveals a search bar in the header, and the chevron for switching
        between hubs appears on non-hub pages.

      <div class="content-subtitle font-bold web-thin">Header (mobile)</div>
      <div class="content-text web-thin">
        While the header was minimal on desktop, it became cluttered on mobile,
        especially on non-hub pages. The breadcrumb nav was crammed and prone to
        cutting off as users navigated deeper into the Help Center.
        Additionally, navigation menus on non-hub pages like "Browse all topics"
        and "In this guide," which were sidebars on desktop, transformed into
        dropdowns on mobile—these required additional clicks, and again,
        contributed to an overcrowded top of page layout.
      </div>
      <img class="content-img" src="img/header-mobile.png" />
      <div class="content-text web-thin">
        To address these issues, I separated the breadcrumb nav from the header
        (detailed in the next section) and consolidated all the header
        buttons—including the new language selector and sign-in buttons—into a
        hamburger menu. Additionally, I relocated the topics browsing feature
        into the same menu to reduce clutter on non-hub pages. By fixing the
        header to the top of the page, users can now access the topics menu at
        any location, regardless of their page or scroll depth. This change is a
        key improvement over the previous design where users had to scroll back
        to the top to browse topics.

        Breadcrumb nav + article page
      </div>
      <div class="content-text web-thin">
        In the current design, the breadcrumb nav is attached to the header and
        appears on every page, which feels unnecessary, particularly on hub
        pages, where users haven’t navigated yet. Some breadcrumbs are
        especially awkward, such as the “Search” breadcrumb on the search
        results page, since search is a global function and not part of a linear
        navigation path (results vary depending on the query). The “Home”
        breadcrumb, which is present on every single page and leads back to the
        parent hub page, also felt redundant—data showed that users rarely
        switch between hubs—and somewhat misleading. This was especially true
        for signed-in users, where the Retailer and Brand hubs functioned better
        as home pages, since they are the default Help Center landing pages for
        their respective user type. Additionally, on article pages, the article
        breadcrumb felt repetitive, appearing directly above the article title.

      <img class="content-img" src="img/breadcrumb-nav.png" />
      <div class="content-text web-thin">
        To improve clarity, I detached the breadcrumb nav from the header and
        removed it from all pages except article pages. It's important to note
        that on non-hub pages, the hub (home) pages and topic pages can always
        be accessed through the header lockup and sidebar. For article pages, I
        simplified the breadcrumb nav by removing the "Retailer/Brand Guides"
        and article title breadcrumbs, leaving only the "Home" breadcrumb (which
        now links back to the appropriate hub page) and the topic breadcrumb,
        representing the topic to which the article belongs.

      <div class="content-subtitle font-bold web-thin">Search results page</div>
      <div class="content-text web-thin">
        In the current state, the search results page is cluttered with
        repetitive elements, specifically the same ‘Read more’ links and
        dividers for each article. This is especially problematic on mobile,
        where it leads to excessive scrolling. Additionally, users can only
        click the 'Read more' link to navigate to an article, which feels
        limiting and requires precise interaction with the mouse or touch input.
      </div>
      <img class="content-img" src="img/search-results.png" />
      <div class="content-text web-thin">
        I streamlined the search results page by removing unnecessary elements
        and incorporating topic tags for better context on each article, reusing
        the article component developed for the hub pages. Keyword highlights
        were added to make scanning for relevant results easier, and now the
        entire article container is clickable, making navigation less strict. I
        also introduced a hover state for the article container, which did not
        exist in the previous design, providing users with clearer visual
        feedback. Additionally, I made a small QoL improvement by displaying the
        total number of search results and implementing pagination to improve
        load times and reduce excessive scrolling.

      <div class="content-subtitle font-bold web-thin">Topic page</div>
      <div class="content-text web-thin">
        The current state of the topics page closely resembled the search
        results page, featuring the same article component that included a
        title, snippet, 'Read more' link, and divider. I simplified the page by
        displaying only the article titles. This change made sense because users
        navigating to a topic page typically have a clear idea of what they’re
        looking for, making the snippets less necessary. By removing the
        snippets and 'Read more' links and making the article titles the
        clickable links, I reduced visual clutter and optimized space on the
        page. This streamlined layout not only improved scannability but also
        minimized excessive scrolling, especially on mobile devices where these
        issues are emphasized.

      <div class="content-text web-thin">
        After finalizing the designs, our engineer implemented them on staging,
        and I conducted several rounds of QA, creating JIRA tickets for any
        issues identified. Once the build was finalized, we proceeded with the
        experiments for both Retailers and Brands.
      </div>
      <div class="content-text web-thin">
        For the Retailer experiment, which targeted logged-in users across all
        geographies, we bucketed when they visit the Help Center home page. This
        approach was essential due to the significant change of removing the
        parent hub. The experiment utilized a 50/50 testing split among users
        and required ~78K samples, with an estimated total duration of 3 months,
        incorporating 1 month for samples to cure. A 3.5% minimum detectable
        effect (MDE) was established at a 90% confidence level. The treatment
        variant included all the design changes, excluding the updated article
        components on hub pages. The control variant featured no changes.
      </div>
      <div class="content-text web-thin">
        Similarly, the Brand experiment focused solely on logged-in users, with
        a 100% treatment group. Like the Retailer XP, this experiment bucketed
        at the Help Center home page and required ~21K samples over an estimated
        4.5 months, with a 5% MDE at 80% confidence. The treatment variant also
        featured all design changes, and both experiments adhered to a "Do No
        Harm" principle, ensuring that the updates would not negatively impact
        customer experience (CX) metrics.

      <div class="content-text web-thin">
        As the experiment is still ongoing, continuous monitoring will be needed
        to assess the effectiveness of the Help Center revamp. Early
        observations indicated promising improvements, with metrics reflecting
        an estimated 7.2% increase in user engagement with Help Center articles
        for Retailers and a 6.5% increase for Brands. Additionally, there was a
        6.3% reduction in Zendesk tickets created for Retailers, while Brands
        saw a 5.4% decrease. In terms of search completions, Retailers
        experienced a 7.4% improvement, whereas Brands noted a 5.8% increase.
      </div>
      <div class="content-text-last web-thin">
        In addition to monitoring the experiment, it’s important to update the
        Help Center alongside the broader Support Experience initiatives that
        are in the pipeline. As mentioned earlier, the Support Experience pod
        plans to roll out an AI support chatbot, conduct a comprehensive content
        audit for the Help Center, refresh the support issue taxonomy, and
        standardize CSAT collection. Aligning the Help Center updates with these
        initiatives (once they're implemented) will ensure a cohesive and
        consistent user experience across Faire's support ecosystem.
      </div>
      <div class="content-title font-bold web-thin">Lessons Learned</div>
      <div class="content-text web-thin">
        I’m really glad I had the opportunity to lead the Help Center revamp—it
        was incredibly fulfilling to influence nearly every aspect and take on a
        scope much larger than I initially expected. This experience taught me
        to balance broad project ownership while still focusing on the finer
        design details. Working closely with the engineering and strategy teams
        highlighted how important it is to bring together different perspectives
        and data-driven insights in decision-making, all while keeping
        feasibility and time constraints in mind. This was also my first time
        conducting formal QAs on staging builds, and communicating with the
        engineering team was super useful to ensure we were all on the same
        page.
      </div>
      <div class="content-text web-thin">
        A key takeaway for me is the importance of setting context specific for
        different audiences—it's vital to understand key differences in working
        and communicating with collaborators versus decision makers to keep
        projects moving efficiently.

            signposting, and offering more robust navigation options to support
            wayfinding. In his design process, Chris efficiently explored
