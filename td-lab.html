        My Role
      </div>
      <div class="content-section">
        During my internship at TD Lab, I designed a mobile app that teaches
        newcomers about cultural differences between their home country and
        Canada. Ultimately, the end goal of the app was to gain more TD
        customers (i.e. open more TD accounts).
      </div>
      <div class="content-last-section">
        I was the UI/UX designer for the project, creating user flows, mockups,
        prototypes, and conducting user and usability testing interviews. I worked alongside several
        developers who coded the app and two business analysts who provided
        research and insights.

        TD’s Everyday Banking team presented the lab with the opportunity
        statement above and asked us to come up with a solution. To scope the
        upcoming project and ideate a solution, we held a week-long design
        sprint. During the sprint, we selected the primary users, researched
        existing competition, and brainstormed potential solutions through
        discussion and sketching.

        Primary Users
      </div>
      <div class="content-last-section">
        Indian newcomers were designated as the primary users of the solution.
        They were chosen for the following reasons:
        <ul>
          <li>
            India represents 12% of all recent immigration to Canada and over
            147,000 new residents
          </li>
          <li>English is a co-official language in India</li>
          <li>
            Indian immigrants are the youngest on average and have the highest
            amount of immigrants in the 25 - 35 year old range, characteristics
            of a population that are beginning their banking journey
          </li>
          <li>
            India places a heavy focus on large financial obligations, such as
            buying/leasing a vehicle or the arrival of a child
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="content-section-title">
        Competition
      </div>
      <div class="content-last-section">
        A competitive analysis of the types of products/services the Big Five
        banks were offering to Canadian newcomers was conducted. Including TD,
        each bank offered some type of newcomer package for opening an account,
        with a few banks also offering pre-arrival checklists. Instead of making
        our users read through another dull checklist, we wanted to present the
        same type of information in a more unique and engaging way.
      </div>
      <div class="content-section-title">
        First Iteration
      </div>
      <div class="content-section">
        Combining several ideas from the design sprint and taking note of
        competing products/services, the team came up with the following
        solution: a mobile app that took users step-by-step through the
        immigration process, ensuring that they didn’t miss anything important.
        Similar to a guide, the app would assist users with things like
        completing important documents, estimating expenses, booking flights,
        and more. In addition to this, the app would provide users with their
        own TD 'e-card'. Users would be able to earn points by completing steps
        within the app and once they had arrived in Canada, they could redeem
        their points for a monetary value by opening an account at a nearby TD
        branch.

        Project Redefinition
      </div>
      <div class="content-last-section">
        With a timeline of four months, we quickly realized that the current
        scope was too large, especially for a mobile app. Our solution was
        trying to do too many things (a checklist for both pre- and post-arrival
        with an incentivization aspect). It seemed unlikely that a mobile app
        would be enough to satisfy the needs of a user during their entire
        immigration process; perhaps the biggest transitional and most stressful
        period a person may experience. Taking a step back and keeping these
        things in mind, we decided to redefine the project.
      </div>
      <div class="content-section-title">
        Second Iteration
      </div>
      <div class="content-section">
        Starting back at square one, we made sure we approached the problem
        correctly this time around. We conducted user interviews to truly
        understand the whole immigration process and the problems new immigrants
        faced.
      </div>
      <div class="content-section">
        We discovered that if a user wanted to know something about immigration,
        they would simply do a quick google search and that the most trustworthy
        sources were Canadian government websites. In other words, there was no
        reason to download an app to find information that was easily accessible
        through a couple of clicks. Not only that, but providing immigration
        information on an app could pose liability problems. With these new
        insights, we decided to create a product that was more casual, but still
        provided relevant and useful information, effectively differentiating us
        from the rest of the competition.
      </div>
      <div class="content-last-section">
        Enter N2C (Newcomer to Canada), a mobile app that teaches users about
        the cultural differences between their home country and Canada. Using
        both the user’s country of origin and their current location, N2C
        creates a customized experience by providing tailored information for
        the user. Like the first iteration, N2C would have a rewards system to
        earn points that could be redeemed for money by opening a TD account.
      </div>
      <div class="content-section-title">
        Cultural Difference?
      </div>
      <div class="content-section">
        <blockquote id="td-hmw">
          <i
            >Bagged milk is common in many parts of Canada. They are usually
            stored in a pitcher or jug with one of the corners cut off to allow
            for pouring.</i
          >
        </blockquote>
      </div>
      <div class="content-last-section">
        This statement is obvious to Ontarians, but what about a new immigrant?
        In every other country (and even other provinces and territories in
        Canada), milk is packaged in cartons, jugs, or bottles. N2C is filled
        with cultural differences like these, ranging over many topics like
        Food, Banking, Laws, Housing, and more. It’s easy to google, “What
        immigration forms do I need to complete?”, but many users don’t know
        what they don’t know and that isn't easy to search for. Everyday,
        newcomers experience different pain points related to niche things they
        haven't learned about, like for example, "How much do I tip? What even
        is tipping?". The purpose of N2C is to alleviate these daily
        difficulties, making users' move to Canada easy and welcoming.

        Usability Testing
      </div>
      <div class="content-section">
        After designing mockups and creating a prototype, it was time to
        validate the idea. We A/B tested two versions of N2C (TD-branded vs.
        non-branded) with six end-users, all Indian immigrants who permanently
        moved to Canada within the last five years.
      </div>
      <div class="content-section">
        Here are the key insights we learned from the testing interviews:
        <ul>
          <li>
            The most important topics in order were:
            <b>Laws, Banking, and Housing</b>
          </li>
          <li>
            The least important topics were: <b>Entertainment and Sports</b>
          </li>
          <li>
            Users wanted reccomendations from the app (ex. suggesting nearby
            places of worship)
          </li>
          <li>
            Users responded positively to the colorful non-branded version, as
            opposed to the TD-branded version
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="content-last-section">
        Overall, user feedback of the app was positive, with several users
        mentioning that if it existed, they would have downloaded it when they
        first came to Canada. The majority of users also thought that being able
        to earn and redeem points for money was a great incentive to invest time
        into the app, and eventually open a TD account. We heard many personal
        anecdotes from users regarding specific things that they did not know
        about, so once the interviews were complete, we knew the concept of N2C
        showed real value.
      </div>
      <div class="content-section-title">
        Final Iteration
      </div>
      <div class="content-last-section">
        Taking the feedback from the testing interviews, I implemented design
        changes in the next and final iteration. Here’s a highlight of what was
        added/changed:
        <ul>
          <li>Onboarding and authentication</li>
          <li>Profile</li>
          <li>
            A complete rewards system (i.e. more ways to earn points and money!)
          </li>
          <li>Edited colours for accessibility purposes</li>
        </ul>
