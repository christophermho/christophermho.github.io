            My Role
        </div>
        <div class="content-section">                
            As part of my internship at TD Lab, I designed a mobile app that teaches newcomers about cultural differences between their home country and Canada. Ultimately, the end goal of the app was to earn more TD customers (i.e. open more TD accounts).
        </div>
        <div class="content-last-section">
            I was the UI/UX designer for this project, creating user flows, mockups, prototypes, and conducting user interviews. I worked alongside several developers who coded the app and two business analysts who provided research and insights.

        <div class="content-section">
            <blockquote id="td-hmw"><i>“Canada is expected to welcome one million new permanent residents over the next 3 years. How might TD Bank develop a new digital experience that incentivizes these residents to make TD Bank their bank of choice?”</i></blockquote>

        <div class="content-last-section">
            TD’s Everyday Banking team presented us at the lab with the opportunity statement above and asked us to come up with a solution. To scope the upcoming project and ideate a solution, we held a week-long design sprint. During the sprint, we selected the primary users, looked into existing competition, and most importantly, brainstormed potential solutions through discussion and sketching. Pictured below are results of the sprint.

            Primary Users
        </div>
        <div class="content-last-section">
            With research provided from our business analysts, Indian newcomers were chosen as the primary users for the app. They were chosen for the following reasons:
            <ul>
                <li>India represents 12% of all recent immigration to Canada and over 147,000 new residents</li>
                <li>India has English as a co-official language</li>
                <li>Indian immigrants are the youngest on average and have the highest representation of all immigrants in the 25 - 34 year old range; these characteristics lend themselves to a population that is beginning their banking journey</li>
                <li>India places a heavy focus on large financial obligations, such as buying/leasing a vehicle or the arrival of a new child</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="content-section-title">
            Competition
        </div>
        <div class="content-last-section">                
           A competitive analysis of the types of products/services the Big Five banks were offering to Canadian newcomers was completed. Including TD, each bank offered some type of newcomer package for opening an account, with a few banks also offering pre-arrival checklists. We wanted to present the same type of information to users, but in a more unique and engaging way, instead of making them read through another dull checklist.
        </div>
        <div class="content-section-title">
            First Iteration
        </div>
        <div class="content-section">                
           Combining several ideas from the design sprint into one and taking note of competing products/services, the team came up with the following solution: a mobile app that took users step-by-step through the immigration process, ensuring that they didn’t miss anything important. Similar to a guide, the app would assist users with things like completing important documents, estimating expenses, booking flights, and more. In addition to this, the app also provided users with their own TD 'e-card'. Users would earn points by completing steps within the app and once they arrived in Canada, they could go to a nearby TD branch and open an account to redeem their points for some monetary value.

            <p>First iteration of the mobile app</p>
        <div class="content-last-section">                
           In India, only 1/4 adults use the internet. Since the majority of immigrants coming to Canada are categorized under the economic class (immigrants that meet current labour needs, own/manage a business, or make substantial monetary investments in the Canadian economy), it could be expected that Indian immigrants are among the 25% of Indians that are more technology perceptive. A mobile platform was chosen for this reason.

        <div class="content-section-title">
            Redefining the Project
        </div>
        <div class="content-last-section">                
           With less than four months to complete the project, we quickly realized that the current scope was too large, especially for a mobile app. Our solution was trying to do too many things (a checklist for both pre-arrival and post-arrival with an incentivization aspect). It seemed unlikely that a mobile app would be enough to satisfy the needs of a user during their entire immigration process; perhaps the biggest transitional and most stressful period a person may experience. Not only that, but the 'e-card' felt out of place, as if TD was shoehorned in because it needed to be there. Taking a step back and keeping these things in mind, we decided to redefine the project. 
        </div>
        <div class="content-section-title">
            Second Iteration
        </div>
        <div class="content-section">                
           Rather than making another newcomer package or rigid checklist, we decided to build a more fun and engaging experience for the user that would still be useful. At this time, we focused solely on solving a problem newcomers experience and didn’t think about how to include TD. Starting back at square one, we made sure we approached the problem correctly this time around.  
        </div>
        <div class="content-section">                
           We conducted user interviews to truly understand the whole immigration process and the problems new immigrants faced. We discovered that if a user wanted to know something about immigration, they would just do a quick google search and that the most trustworthy sources were official Canadian government websites. In other words, there was no reason to download an app to find information that was easily accessible through a couple of clicks. Not only that, but providing immigration information on an app could pose liability problems. With these new insights, we decided to create a product that was more casual, but still provided relevant and useful information, effectively differentiating us from the rest of the competition. 
        </div>
        <div class="content-section">                
           Enter N2C (Newcomer to Canada), a mobile app that teaches users about the niche cultural differences between their home country and Canada. Using both the user’s country of origin and their current location, N2C creates a customized experience by providing tailored information. But what does a 'cultural difference' entail exactly? Let me explain with an example. 
        </div>
        <div class="content-section">
            <blockquote><i>Bagged milk is common in many parts of Canada. They are usually stored in a pitcher or jug with one of the corners cut off to allow for pouring.</i></blockquote>
        </div>
        <div class="content-last-section">                
           This statement is obvious to us, Canadians, but what about for a new immigrant? In every other country (and even other provinces and territories in Canada) of the world, milk is packaged in cartons, jugs, or bottles. N2C is filled with facts like these, ranging over many topics like Food, Banking, Laws, Housing, and more. It’s easy to google, “What immigration forms do I need to complete?”, but many users don’t know what they don’t know and that isn't easy to search for. Everyday, newcomers experience different pain points related to niche things they haven't learned about, like, "How much do I tip? What even is tipping?". The purpose of N2C is to alleviate these pain points by teaching users about cultural differences, making their move to Canada easy and welcoming.

            User Research
        </div>
        <div class="content-section">                
           After designing some mockups and creating a prototype, it was time to validate the idea. We A/B tested two versions of N2C (TD-branded vs. non-branded) with six end-users, all Indian immigrants who moved to Canada permanently within the last five years. 
        </div>
        <div class="content-section">
            Here are the key insights we learned from the interviews:
            <ul>
                <li>The most important topics in order were: Laws, Banking, and Housing</li>
                <li>The least important topics were: Entertainment and Sports</li>
                <li>If the app provided recommendations that would be the most useful (ex. suggesting nearby places of worship)</li>
                <li>Users responded positively to the use of different colours in the non-branded version, while the TD-branded version felt like an ad</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="content-last-section">                
           Overall, user feedback of the app was positive, with several users mentioning that they would've downloaded it when they first came to Canada. We heard many personal anecdotes from users regarding niche things that they didn’t know about, so once the interviews were complete, we knew the concept of N2C showed real value.

            Taking the feedback from the user interviews, I implemented design changes in the next and final iteration. Here’s a highlight of what was added/changed:

                <li>Onboarding and authentication</li>
                <li>Profile</li>
                <li>Edited app colours for accessibility purposes</li>
