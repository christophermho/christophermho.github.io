          wireframes and facilitating team discussion.

          To better understand the types of products and services TD Bank and
          the other Big Five banks (RBC, BMO, CIBC, and Scotiabank) were
          currently offering to recent immigrants, we reviewed their newcomer
          packages on their websites.

            Every bank offered a newcomer package with perks for opening an
            account with them (ex. no monthly and/or international transfer
            fees, cash bonuses, special credit cards, etc)
          </li>

          Indian immigrants were chosen as the primary users for the following

          <li class="bullet-point">
            They are the youngest on average and have the highest amount of
            immigrants in their twenties and thirties — characteristics of a
            population that are beginning their banking journey
          </li>
          <li class="bullet-point">
            They place a focus on large financial obligations (ex. buying a
            vehicle or the birth of a child)

        <div class="content-text-last">
          The first iteration was an app that guided users step-by-step through
          the immigration process. It would assist with tasks like completing
          important documents, estimating expenses, booking flights, and more.
          By completing tasks, users would earn points — redeemable for cash by
          opening a TD Bank account.

        <div class="content-text">
          While the initial design seemed useful, we couldn’t be sure without
          actually consulting the end-users. To ensure we were correctly
          approaching the problem, I conducted user interviews with six Indian
          immigrants who had moved to Canada within the last five years.
        </div>
        <ul class="content-text content-highlight-td-lab">
          <span class="bold">Key Insights</span>
          <li class="bullet-point">
            If a user needed information about the Canadian immigration process,
            they would simply do a quick google search
          </li>
          <li class="bullet-point">
            The most trustworthy sources of information were Government of
            Canada websites — it was unlikely any other sources would be used
          </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="content-text-last">
          In other words, there was little reason for users to download a
          non-Government of Canada app to find information that was more
          accessible and trustworthy through a couple of clicks. Additionally,
          providing immigration information could pose liability problems if it
          was not constantly accurate and updated.

        <div class="content-title font-bold">A Step Back</div>
        <div class="content-text-last">
          With these findings, we decided to re-evaluate our approach by
          redefining the product. We needed to create a product that was more
          casual, but still provided relevant and useful information —
          effectively differentiating itself from the existing competition.

          Enter the next iteration, a mobile app that taught users about the
          cultural differences between their home country and Canada. A
          customized experience is created by providing tailored information for
          the user based on their home country and current location. Like the
          first iteration, there would be a rewards system to earn points that
          could be redeemed for cash by opening a TD Bank account.

          Every day Canadian newcomers experience several pain points related to
          niche topics they haven't learned about. For example, "How much should
          I tip in Canada? What even is tipping? Why is milk bagged?" Many
          newcomers don’t know what they don’t know and that isn't easy to
          search for. By providing information on these niche topics (i.e.
          cultural differences), we can alleviate these daily difficulties,
          making the move to Canada easy, welcoming, and stress-free.

        <div class="content-title font-bold">Usability Testing</div>
        <div class="content-text">
          After designing the UI and a high-fidelity prototype, it was time to
          validate the idea. I usability tested the app with same six Indian
          immigrants from the original user interviews.

            The most important topics in order: Laws, Finance, and Housing

          <li class="bullet-point">
            Users wanted to receive reccomendations (ex. suggesting nearby
            places of worship)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="content-text-last">
          Overall, user feedback of the app was positive — several users
          mentioned that if the app existed when they had first moved to Canada,
          they would have downloaded and used it. They also thought the
          opportunity to earn and redeem points for cash was a great incentive
          to invest time in the app, and eventually open a TD Bank account.
          Users also mentioned many personal anecdotes regarding niche things
          they didn't know about when they immigrated, so we knew the concept
          showed real value.

        <div class="content-text">
          Incorporating feedback from the usability testing interviews, the
          final iteration was improved upon — I added a complete onboarding
          flow, profile, and a more in-depth rewards system (i.e. more ways to
          earn points/cash). Following this, Newcomer to Canada was fully
          developed as a mobile iOS app by the engineering team and presented to
          EVPs and SVPs at TD Bank Tower in Downtown Toronto.
