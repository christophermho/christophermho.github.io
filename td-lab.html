      <div class="content-text-last">
        TD Lab is an innovation workspace within TD Bank, exploring emerging
        tech & customer experiences. During my internship, I led the design of a
        mobile app, N2C (Newcomer to Canada) that helps Canadian newcomers
        settle in by teaching them about cultural differences between their home
        country and Canada.
      </div>
      <div class="content-title">Problem</div>
      <div class="content-text">
        TD’s Everyday Banking team presented our team with the opportunity
        statement below:
      </div>
      <div class="content-text-last font-italicize text-align-center">
        “Canada is expected to welcome 1 million new permanent residents over
        the next 3 years. How might TD Bank develop a new digital experience
        to incentivize these residents to make TD Bank their bank of choice?”

      <div class="content-title">Goal</div>
      <div class="content-text">
        <span class="font-bold">Canadian Newcomers</span><br />• &nbsp To have a
        stress-free immigration process, including opening a Canadian banking
        account<br /><span class="font-bold">TD Bank</span><br />• &nbsp To ease
        Canadian newcomers’ immigration process and gain more customers (i.e.
        open more bank accounts)
      </div>
      <div class="content-text-last">
        To scope the project, we held a design sprint. We researched existing
        competition, selected primary users, mapped their journey, and
        brainstormed potential solutions by sketching wireframes and disccusing
        as a team.
      </div>
      <div class="content-title">Competitive Analysis</div>
      <div class="content-text-last">
        To gain a better understanding of the types of products and services
        banks were offering to Canadian newcomers, we looked at the websites of
        the Big Five Banks (TD, RBC, Scotiabank, BMO, CIBC).

      </div>
      <div class="content-title">Initial Design</div>
      <div class="content-text-last">
        The initial design was a mobile app that took users step-by-step through
        the immigration process. Similar to a guide, the app would assist users
        with tasks like completing important documents, estimating expenses,
        booking flights, etc. Also, a TD 'E-card' would be offered to the user.
        Users would be able to earn points by completing steps within the app
        and could redeem their points for a monetary value by opening a Canadian
        TD bank account.
      </div>
      <img class="content-img" src="img/td-lab-initial-design.png" />
      <div class="content-title">User Interviews + Project Redefinition</div>
      <div class="content-text">
        While the initial design seemed useful, we couldn’t be sure without
        actually consulting the users. We also thought the design seemed too
        similar to existing competition (i.e. an immigration checklist, which TD
        Bank already offers). To make sure we were correctly approaching the
        problem, I conducted user interviews with recent Canadian immigrants to
        truly understand the problems they faced during their immigration
        process.
      </div>
      <div class="content-text">
        <span class="font-bold">Key Insights</span><br />• &nbsp If a user
        needed information about the Canadian immigration process, they would
        simply do a quick google search<br />• &nbsp The most trustworthy
        sources were Canadian government websites<br />• &nbsp Lorem ipsum
      </div>
      <div class="content-text">
        In other words, there was little reason for users to download an app to
        find information that was more accessible and trustworthy, through a
        couple of clicks. Also, providing immigration information could pose
        liability problems if it was not constantly accurate and updated.
      </div>
      <div class="content-text-last">
        With these insights, we decided to redefine the project. We wanted to
        create a product that was more casual, but still provided relevant and
        useful information, effectively differentiating itself from the current
        competition.
      </div>
      <div class="content-title">New Design</div>
      <div class="content-text-last">
        Enter N2C (Newcomer to Canada), a mobile app that teaches users about
        the cultural differences between their home country and Canada. Using
        both the user’s country of origin and their current location, N2C
        creates a customized experience by providing tailored information for
        the user. Like the first iteration, N2C would have a rewards system to
        earn points that could be redeemed for money by opening a TD account.
      </div>
      <img class="content-img" src="img/td-lab-new-design.png" />
      <div class="content-text-last">
        Everyday, newcomers experience different pain points related to niche
        things they haven't learned about, like for example, "How much do I tip?
        What even is tipping?" N2C is filled with cultural differences like
        these, ranging over many topics. The purpose of N2C is to alleviate
        these daily difficulties, making users' move to Canada easy and
        welcoming. It’s easy to google, “What immigration forms do I need to
        complete?”, but many users don’t know what they don’t know and that
        isn't easy to search for.
      </div>
      <div class="content-title">Usability Testing</div>
      <div class="content-text">
        After designing mockups and creating a prototype, it was time to
        validate the idea. I tested N2C with six users, all Indian immigrants
        who permanently moved to Canada within the last five years.
      </div>
      <div class="content-text">
        <span class="font-bold">Key Insights</span><br />• &nbsp The most
        important topics to users in order were: Laws, Banking, and Housing<br />•
        &nbsp The least important topics to users were: Entertainment and
        Sports<br />• &nbsp Users wanted reccomendations from the app (ex.
        suggesting nearby places of worship)
      </div>
      <div class="content-text-last">
        Overall, user feedback of the app was positive, with several users
        mentioning that if N2C existed, they would have downloaded it when they
        first came to Canada. The majority of users also thought that being able
        to earn and redeem points for money was a great incentive to invest time
        into the app, and eventually open a TD bank account. Users mentioned
        many personal anecdotes regarding specific things that they did not know
        about when they first came to Canada, so we knew the concept of N2C
        showed real value.
      </div>
      <div class="content-title">Final Design Changes</div>
      <div class="content-text">
        Incorporating feedback from the usability testing interviews, I
        implemented design changes in the next and final iteration. Here’s a
        highlight of what was added:
