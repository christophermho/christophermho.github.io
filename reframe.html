        Reframe is a fitness app that leverages the framing effect to positively
        shape the perception of fitness goals and workout routines, making them
        feel more attainable. It aims to improve accountability and increase
        motivation for people struggling to achieve and sustain their fitness
        goals.

      <div class="content-text web-thin">
        Depending on whether I was on summer break or in school, my lifestyle
        alternated between consistent exercise, healthy eating, and sufficient
        sleep, and phases where the opposite was true. My motivation and
        discipline always decreased with the demands of school, leading me to
        stop exercising at all. However, I noticed that as long as I pushed
        myself to JUST get to the gym, I completed my workout, regardless of how
        I initially felt.

        Half of the individuals struggling with fitness planned on using an app
        to help them, so it was important to figure out what the top fitness

        as Strava and Nike Training Club.

        While their specific features vary, the overarching theme among these
        apps is to asssist users on their fitness journey with quantitative
        tools and information. They also integrate qualitative aspects like goal
        setting, community engagement, and motivational content, but their
        primary use is for tracking and analyzing data and metrics.

        Given the oversaturation of the fitness apps on the market and the

      <div class="content-text web-thin">
        To better understand why people fail to achieve or stay consistent with
        their fitness goals, I conducted user interviews with 5 participants,
        ranging from students and young working adults who have been putting off
        or taken a pause on their fitness journey. I also conducted secondary
        research on what consistent people do and grouped the data into affinity
        maps.

        Taking all the competitor and user research into account, I noticed
        fitness apps weren't tackling the mental aspect of the fitness journey.
        The hardest part of fitness is starting and gym newbies were setting
        themselves up for failure by creating mental obstacles they weren't even
        aware of themselves. On the other hand, fit people suceeded by having a
        different frame of mind regarding going to the gym and fitness in
        general.

        <div class="content-text-last web-thin">
          I started off designing low-fidelity wireframes and conducted three
          rounds of usability testing to figure out what worked and what didn't,
          and iterated accordingly.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="content-title font-bold web-thin">Goals (Guided Tour)</div>
      <div class="content-text web-thin">
        On first use, users would have to be introduced to the concept of
        reframing fitness goals. This started off as more of a quickstart guide
        — users would start at Today and be prompted to head to Goals to start
        the process of reframing their general fitness goals they selected
        during onboarding. Screens with expository text would explain reframing
        and the user would then receive suggested reframed goals that they could
        choose to add.
      </div>
      <img
        class="content-img web-thin"
        src="img/reframe-quickstart-guide.png"
      />
      <div class="content-text-last web-thin">
        After testing, it was quickly evident that there was an overwhelming
        amount of expository text that was likely to be skipped over. Users were
        also confused about the suggested goals — it was assumed they were
        automatically added and that they didn't need to manually do it
        themselves. Also, the suggested goals weren't tailored enough, so users
        didn't feel personally motivated in achieving them. This led to using a
        guided tour with reduced expository text instead. It was also important
        to provide examples of specified and reframed goals, so that we could
        help users figure out how to improve their goals on their own — creating
        a more personal connection and greater motivation in achieving them.
      </div>
      <div class="content-title font-bold web-thin">Goals (New Goal)</div>
      <div class="content-text web-thin">
        After becoming familiar with the concept of reframing goals, users would
        need the option to add goals they reframed on their own or seek
        assistance in creating reframed goals. The initial design had users
        input a new goal and receive suggestions for reframed goals.
      </div>
      <img class="content-img web-thin" src="img/reframe-new-goal.png" />
      <div class="content-text-last web-thin">
        Once again, testing indicated that providing generated goal suggestions
        was not properly tailored or engaging at all for users. It was better
        for users to come up with a reframed goal on their own (with some
        assistance) — doing so made them feel personally invested in actually
        working toward and achieving said goal. This led to asking users a
        question(s) based on their inputted goal, that could help them figure
        out how to reframe their goal on their own.
      </div>
      <div class="content-title font-bold web-thin">
        Workout (Start a Workout)
      </div>
      <div class="content-text web-thin">
        Struggling to find the "perfect" workout routine was a pain point for
        users, so the design needed to emphasize the notion that there's no such
        thing as a perfect routine and doing something is always better than
        doing nothing. This was the reasoning for the expository text presented
        on first use. The initial design of the tailored workout asked users
        which muscle group and isolated muscle they wanted to work on. After
        choosing, three exercise targets would be provided — ideally users would
        complete every target, but if they weren't feeling it, atleast they did
        something (minimum target).
      </div>
      <img class="content-img web-thin" src="img/reframe-start-a-workout.png" />
      <div class="content-text web-thin">
        Similar to the Goals quickstart guide, testing indicated that the
        expository text was too overwhelming and likely to be skipped over.
        Users also found having to choose which muscle group and exercise to
        work on was confusing and intimidating — not everyone was familar with
        fitness jargon and having to choose often led to overthinking and
        created another obstacle to motivation.
      </div>
      <div class="content-text-last web-thin">
        The design needed to make the fitness journey as simple and stress-free
        as possible. I made the decision to remove the expository screens and
        opted for a brief pop-up dialog instead. Tailored workouts removed any
        user selection (besides selecting an exercise based on available
        equipment) to prevent users from becoming overwhelmed. I also made the
        ideal and best exercise targets become visible only when the user had
        completed the minimum target to keep the user focused on their immediate
        task at hand.
      </div>
      <div class="content-title font-bold web-thin">Final Design</div>
      <div class="content-text web-thin">
        After iterating based on insights from testing, I created a
        high-fidelity design and design system.

    </div>
    <img class="content-img web-thin" src="img/reframe-final-design.png" />

      />
      <div class="content-title font-bold web-thin">Next Steps</div>
      <div class="content-text-last web-thin">
        Many of the design changes made during iterations were based on insights
        gathered from testing with users from one age bracket (19-32 years). An
        appropriate next step would be to test the design and validate the user
        experience choices with older age brackets to see how I could tailor the
        experience differently. It would also be useful to explore having a
        mascot, similar to Duolingo's owl Duo. Having an approachable character
        could enhance the user experience by offering encouragement and
        guidance, and fostering motivation as users progress through their
        fitness journey.
      </div>
      <div class="content-title font-bold web-thin">Lessons Learned</div>
      <div class="content-text-final web-thin">
        Working on Reframe taught me a lot about the importance of user
        research. Engaging with users early and often is vital in refining an
        app's usability and I got to experience actively applying the things I
        learned to the choices I made on UX and interaction patterns. As a solo
        designer, project management skills were also important, from setting
        realistic timelines to balancing design iterations. This project taught
        me to stay adaptable and to maintain a user-centric approach in crafting
        meaningful and intuitive digital experiences.
