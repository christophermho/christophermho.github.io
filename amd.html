        Radeon Software (RS) is a device driver and utility package for AMD’s
        Radeon graphics cards and APUs. RS includes features like game profile
        management, performance monitoring, recording and streaming, and more.
        <!-- Every Christmas, AMD releases a new driver that introduces several new
        software features, adding to the functionality of AMD Radeon graphics
        cards. -->
        During my internship, I worked on the upcoming release of the RS
        Adrenalin 2020 Edition (RSA 2020). I focused on improving the UX by
        designing and usability testing a high fidelity prototype.
      </div>
      <div class="content-title">Current State</div>
      <div class="content-text-last">
        Prior to the release of the RSA 2020, the software was known as Radeon
        Settings (Adrenalin 2019 Edition). This version had a UI that had been
        used for years — users were extremely familiar with the information
        architecture and very comfortable with navigation.
      </div>
      <img class="content-img" src="img/amd-current-state.png" />
      <div class="content-title">Future State</div>
      <div class="content-text-last">
        In the the upcoming RSA 2020 driver update, RS would have a completely
        redesigned UI and a number of new innovative features like Radeon Boost,
        Radeon Anti-Lag, Radeon Image Sharpening, Radeon Integer Display
        Scaling, AMD Link Streaming, and Integrated Web Browsing.
      </div>
      <img class="content-img" src="img/amd-future-state.png" />
      <div class="content-text-last">
        Most of the UI for RSA 2020 was complete when I started my internship.
        However, the actual UX of the new design had not been tested yet — using
        the mockups, it was my job to create a high fidelity prototype and
        conduct usability testing. While the future state was more modern and
        sleek, what mattered was if it was actually intuitive or not. Would
        users have an easy time understanding the information architecture and
        navigating the software, let alone even opening the UI in the first
        place?
      </div>
      <div class="content-title">User Flows</div>
      <div class="content-text">
        Since RSA 2020 included several new features, it was necessary to design
        user flows for both new and existing features. It was also important to
        include a variety of tasks for users of different levels of experience
        with gaming and RS (Novice PC User, Entry Level User, Experienced User,
        etc). How would the UX compare for experienced vs. novice users? Keeping
        these in mind, I designed the following user flows and created a high
        fidelity prototype accordingly — complete with animations and overlays.

      <div class="content-text">
        After designing a high fidelity prototype, it was time to test the
        revamped UI and UX. To get some context, I first asked users a couple of
        screening questions:

          uncessary amount of visual space
        </li>
        <li class="bullet-point">
          The UI was mostly easy to navigate, but felt a bit overly complicated
          and layered with the exessive number of nested menus
        </li>
        <li class="bullet-point">
          The majority of users were willing to learn and get used to the new UI
          — a few users were reluctant and preferred the older UI
        </li>
        <li class="bullet-point">
          The new features (i.e. Radeon Boost/Anti-Lag/Image Sharpening/Integer
          Display Scaling) were highly anticipated
        </li>
        <li class="bullet-point">
          There were some concerns with 'bloatware' using excessive RAM (ex.
          questioning the necessity of an integrated web browser)

        Due to product deadlines, RSA 2020 was unfortunately released before any
        design changes could be implemented. However, subsequent releases of RSA
        have received updates based on feedback from both usability testing and
        actual use. RSA's current release is the 2022 Edition and is used by
        millions of gamers around the globe. Below is an introductory video for
        the first release of RSA 2020.
