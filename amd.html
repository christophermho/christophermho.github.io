        specializing in the design and production of computer processors,
        graphics cards, and related technologies. Radeon Software: Adrenalin
        Edition (yes, they spelled 'adrenaline' wrong intentionally), now known
        as AMD Software, serves as the all-in-one driver and utility suite for
        their Radeon graphics cards and APUs. It offers a wide range of
        features, including game profile management, overclocking and
        undervolting options, performance monitoring, as well as recording and
        streaming capabilities.
      </div>
      <div class="content-text-last web-thin">
        During my internship, I worked on the revamped Radeon Software:
        Adrenalin 2020 Edition, which I'll refer to as RSX for short. I focused
        on validating the updated design by creating and usability testing a
        high fidelity prototype, generating insights for future design
        improvments. Other responsibilities during my internship included
        starting RSX's first design system and designing relevant components,
        overlays, and screens when necessary.
      </div>
      <div class="content-title font-bold web-thin">Current State</div>
      <div class="content-text web-thin">
        Prior to the release of RSX, Radeon Software: Adrenalin Edition was in
        its 2019 version, which maintained the same user interface since the end
        of 2015 when it was originally launched as Radeon Software: Crimson
        Edition. While there were slight tweaks made over the years, the core
        tab-based design remained largely unchanged—this continuity facilitated
        easy navigation between various settings and features, as users became
        very familiar and comfortable with its layout.
      </div>
      <img class="content-img-last" src="img/amd-current-state.png" />
      <div class="content-title font-bold web-thin">Future State</div>
      <div class="content-text web-thin">
        The upcoming RSX update would deliver a comprehensive suite of drivers,
        settings, and enhanced features—this included innovative features such
        as Radeon Boost, which dynamically adjusts rendering resolution for
        smoother gameplay; Radeon Anti-Lag, designed to minimize input latency;
        Radeon Image Sharpening for improved visual clarity; Radeon Integer
        Scaling for better retro game displays; AMD Link Streaming for game
        streaming from anywhere; and Integrated Web Browsing, which allowed
        users to conveniently browse the web without leaving the full-screen
        game interface—ideal for quick searches, tutorials, or checking gaming
        forums during gameplay. All of these features were aimed at enhancing
        the gaming experience and optimizing performance.
      </div>
      <img class="content-img" src="img/amd-future-state-1.png" />
      <div class="content-text between-imgs web-thin">
        The biggest change from this update was a completely revamped user
        interface, designed to provide a more modern and user-friendly
        experience. This new interface aimed to enable users to swiftly access
        the latest software features, game statistics, performance reports, and
        driver updates from a single location. This streamlined approach sought
        to create a more immersive gaming experience, ensuring that users could
        efficiently navigate through settings and utilize the full potential of
        their hardware​.
      </div>
      <img class="content-img" src="img/amd-future-state-2.png" />
      <div class="content-text-last web-thin">
        When I joined the team, my primary responsibility was to validate the
        new user interface and experience of RSX. Although the revamped design
        was nearing completion, it had undergone minimal testing with actual
        users. My task was to create a high-fidelity prototype by mapping out
        user flows of the new designs and conduct usability testing. While the
        new interface appeared more modern and sleek, the key question remained:
        was it truly intuitive? Would users find it easy to understand and
        navigate the new UI, or would they hesitate to invest the time needed to
        learn and adapt to it?
      </div>
      <div class="content-title font-bold web-thin">User Flows</div>
      <div class="content-text web-thin">
        Given that RSX introduced several new features, it was essential to
        outline user flows for both new and existing functionalities.
        Additionally, I needed to accommodate users with varying levels of
        experience with gaming and Radeon Software: Adrenalin Edition. How would
        the experience differ for novice versus experienced users? Keeping these
        considerations in mind, I mapped out the user flows and developed a
        high-fidelity prototype that incorporated animations, transitions,
        overlays, and keyboard shortcuts. The prototype was comprehensive,
        featuring multiple pathways to access various functionalities from
        different locations within the interface. This complexity ensured that
        the experience would come as close as possible to the fully developed
        version set for release.

      <div class="content-text web-thin">
        After creating the prototype, it was time to test the new RSX design. To
        effectively synthesize the usability testing data, understanding the
        types of users being interviewed was essential. Different user
        backgrounds and experiences could significantly influence their
        interaction with the software and their feedback on its usability. To
        gain this context, I started by asking users a series of screening
        questions:
      </div>
      <div class="content-text web-thin">
        <ul class="content-text content-highlight-amd">
          <span class="bold color-amd">Screening Questions</span>

        However, there were some reservations among users who preferred the
        simplicity of the previous design. Some expressed concerns about
        potential system slowdowns due to the additional RAM usage of new
        features, perceiving them as potential bloatware. Despite the visual
        appeal of the new UI, some users felt that it took up too much space and
        was overly complicated and layered, with excessive scrolling and too
        many nested menus, making navigation feel confusing.
      </div>
      <div class="content-text web-thin">
        The discoverability of certain features also proved challenging. Many
        users had difficulty finding functionalities that had been replaced or
        merged into newer features, like the confusion around Frame Rate Target
        Control being replaced by Radeon Chill. Additionally, only the
        fullscreen hotkey was explained at launch, leading to misunderstandings
        about the availability of the sidebar view, which caused some
        frustration.
      </div>
      <div class="content-text web-thin">
        Lastly, while core features were well received, a majority of users
        questioned the necessity of some additions, such as the integrated web
        browser and recording and streaming tools. These were seen as less
        relevant to users who did not engage in content creation, with many
