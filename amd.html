          Radeon Software is a device driver and utility software package for
          AMD’s Radeon graphics cards and APUs. It includes features like game
          profile management, performance monitoring, recording/streaming, and
          more.
          <!-- Every Christmas, AMD releases a new driver that introduces several new
        software features, adding to the functionality of AMD Radeon graphics
        cards. -->
          During my internship, I worked on the release of Radeon Software:
          Adrenaline 2020 Edition (RSA 2020). I focused on improving the UX by
          designing and usability testing a high fidelity prototype.

        <div class="content-text-last">
          Prior to the release of RSA 2020, Radeon Software was known as Radeon
          Settings (Adrenaline 2019 Edition). This version had a UI that had
          been used for years — users were extremely familiar with the current
          information architecture and navigation.

        <div class="content-text-last">
          In the the upcoming RSA 2020 driver update, Radeon Software would have
          a completely redesigned UI and a number of new innovative features
          like Radeon Boost, Radeon Anti-Lag, Radeon Image Sharpening, Radeon
          Integer Display Scaling, AMD Link Streaming, and Integrated Web
          Browsing.

        <div class="content-text-last">
          Designed to provide the user with a clean, modern and easy-to-use
          interface where they can quickly access the latest software features,
          game stats, performance reports, driver updates, and much more - all
          from one convenient location, making it even more convenient and easy
          to adjust their favorite features and get a fantastic gaming
          experience.

        <div class="content-text-last">
          While I designed several screens for the RSA 2020 driver update, the
          majority of the UI was already complete when I began my internship.
          However, the UX of the new design had not been tested yet — using the
          mockups, it was my job to create a prototype and conduct usability
          testing. While the future state was more modern and sleek, what
          mattered was if it was actually intuitive or not. Would users have an
          easy time understanding and navigating the new UI, let alone opening
          it in the first place?

        <div class="content-title font-bold">User Flows</div>
        <div class="content-text">
          Since RSA 2020 included several new features, it was necessary to
          design user flows for both new and existing features. It was also
          important to include a variety of tasks for users of different
          experience levels with gaming and Radeon Software. How would the
          experience differ for novice vs. experienced users? With these notes
          in mind, I designed the following user flows and created a high
          fidelity prototype accordingly — complete with animations and
          overlays.

          After creating the prototype, it was time to test the new Radeon
          Software design. To properly synthesize the usability testing data, it
          was neccessary to know what types of users were being interviewed. To
          gain some context, I started by asking the interviewees/users a couple
          of screening questions:

            The UI was smooth and visually appealing, but took up an unnecessary
            amount of space and felt overcomplicated and layered with the

            The new features (i.e. Radeon Boost/Anti-Lag/Image

          Due to product deadlines, RSA 2020 was released before changes could
          be implemented. However, subsequent releases of Radeon Software have
          received updates based on feedback from both usability testing and
          actual use. Radeon Software is currently in its 2022 release and is
          used by millions of gamers around the globe. Below is an introductory
          video for the initial release of RSA 2020.

          Another project I worked on was starting RSA 2020's first design
          system. Given the recent creation of the driver's new UI, an internal
          design system had not been implemented yet. I organized RSA 2020's
          design components and assets into a single file to reduce redudancy
          and ensure visual consistency across both desktop and mobile
          platforms.
