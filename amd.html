        that designs and produces computer processors, graphics cards, and
        related technologies—Radeon Software is the device driver and utility
        software package for their Radeon graphics cards and advanced processing
        units. It includes features like game profile management, overclocking
        and undervolting, performance monitoring, recording and streaming, etc.
      </div>
      <div class="content-text-last web-thin">
        During my internship, I worked on the release of Radeon Software:
        Adrenalin (yes, they spelled it wrong) 2020 Edition, which I'll refer to
        as RSX for short. I focused on validating the design by creating and
        usability testing a high fidelity prototype. Other responsibilities
        during my internship included starting RSX's first design system and
        designing relevant screens and overlays when necessary.
      </div>
      <div class="content-title font-bold web-thin">Current State</div>
      <div class="content-text web-thin">
        Prior to the release of RSX, Radeon Software: Adrenalin was in its 2019
        Edition. This version had a dated UI that had been used for years—users
        were extremely familiar and comfortable with the current information
        architecture and navigation.
      </div>
      <img class="content-img-last" src="img/amd-current-state.png" />
      <div class="content-title font-bold web-thin">Future State</div>
      <div class="content-text web-thin">
        In the the upcoming RSX driver update, Radeon Software would replace
        Radeon Settings as a comprehensive suite that included drivers,
        settings, and additional features for Radeon graphics cards. Some of the
        new innovative features included Radeon Boost, Radeon Anti-Lag, Radeon
        Image Sharpening, Radeon Integer Display Scaling, AMD Link Streaming,
        and Integrated Web Browsing.
      </div>
      <img class="content-img" src="img/amd-future-state-1.png" />
      <div class="content-text web-thin">
        The biggest change Radeon Software brought was a completely revamped
        user interface. Compared to its predecessor, Radeon Software was
        designed to have a more modern and user-friendly interface—the intention
        was to allow users to quickly access the latest software features, game
        stats, performance reports, and driver updates all from one convenient
        location, creating an immersive gaming experience.
      </div>
      <img class="content-img" src="img/amd-future-state-2.png" />
      <div class="content-text-last web-thin">
        When I was brought on board, I was tasked with validating the experience
        of RSX. Despite the revamped design being close to completion, it had
        barely been tested with actual users. Using the existing design, it was
        my job to create a high-fidelity prototype and conduct usability
        testing. While the future state was more modern and sleek, what mattered
        was whether it was actually intuitive or not. Would users have an easy
        time understanding and navigating the new UI, let alone be willing to
        spend the time learning and adopting it?
      </div>
      <div class="content-title font-bold web-thin">User Flows</div>
      <div class="content-text web-thin">
        Since RSX included several new features, it was necessary to design user
        flows for both new and existing features. It was also important to
        include a variety of tasks for users of different experience levels with
        gaming and Radeon Software. How would the experience differ for novice
        vs. experienced users? With these notes in mind, I designed the
        following user flows and created a high fidelity prototype accordingly —
        complete with animations, transitions, overlays, and keyboard shortcuts.

      <div class="content-text web-thin">
        After creating the prototype, it was time to test the new Radeon
        Software design. To properly synthesize the usability testing data, it
        was neccessary to know what types of users were being interviewed. To
        gain some context, I started by asking the users a couple of screening
        questions:

          <li class="bullet-point">
            How many hours do you spend gaming in a week? (Never, 1-10, 11-20,

        </video>
      </div>
      <div class="content-text web-thin">
        Feedback from usability testing was mixed. Some users praised the new
        interface, additional features, and customization options. However,
        other users were more reluctant and much preferred the previous design.
        There were also concerns with the amount of RAM some of the new features
        would take up (i.e. bloatware). On the other hand, certain features like
        Radeon Boost, Anti-Lag, Image Sharpening, and Integer Display Scaling
        were highly anticipated by virtually all users.
      </div>
      <div class="content-text-last web-thin">
        <div class="content-text content-one-highlight-amd">
          The UI was smooth and visually appealing, but took up unnecessary
          space, required too much scrolling, and felt overly complicated and
          layered due to excessive nested menus
        </div>
        <div class="content-text content-one-highlight-amd">
          There was difficulty finding many features, especially ones that had
          been replaced or integrated with new features (ex. Frame Rate Target
          Control replaced by Radeon Chill)
        </div>
        <div class="content-text content-one-highlight-amd">
          Only the fullscreen hotkey was explained on launch, so users did not
          realize the existence of the sidebar view—led to the false belief that
          there was only a fullscreen overlay, which was disliked
        </div>
        <div class="content-text content-one-highlight-amd">
          Majority of users had little to no care for certain features (i.e.
          integrated web browser and the increased focus on recording and
          streaming) and questioned their necessity

      <div class="content-title font-bold web-thin">Results</div>
      <div class="content-text web-thin">
        Due to product deadlines, RSX had to be released before changes could be
        properly implemented. Subsequent releases of Radeon Software have
        received updates based on feedback from both usability testing and
        actual use. Radeon Software is currently in its 2023 release and is used
        by millions of gamers around the globe. Below is an introductory video
        for the initial release of RSX.

        RSX was released immediately after my internship ended—if I had more
        time, I would pay attention to different metrics and KPIs sourced from
        the live release. This would provide me with further data to gauge and
        measure where the new design succeeds and where it could be further
        improved.

      <div class="content-text-final web-thin">
        In the past, I worked in smaller teams on products with smaller scope,
        so working at a large company like AMD taught me valuable lessons. The
        larger scale of product meant more complexity and constant communication
        with the PM, lead designer, and other stakeholders. I also learned that
        complying with user anticipated deadlines can sometimes mean releasing a
        product without all the improvements we wanted to include. This can feel
        disheartening, but is a learning experience—everything is not always
        smooth sailing in real work screnarios. Overall, the experience
        highlighted the importance of clear communication, teamwork, planning,
        and how larger companies operate.
