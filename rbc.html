                    Last winter, I was a part of <i>Xperience First</i>, a newly formed design team within RBC Wealth Management. The team included a total of four UI/UX and product designers (including me), one design strategist, and one design lead. Our goal was to facilitate the adoption of human-centred design into the entirety of WMTS (Wealth Managament Technology & Solutions).

                    Our team was tasked with re-designing the user experience and interface of an internal wire transfer application, as well as the overall process when using said application. Before we could begin re-designing it, we needed to fully understand what the application was used for, how it was used, and its current problems. We conducted twelve interviews with end-users, learning about every touchpoint they go through and their pain points.

                    Besides re-designing digital applications and processes, our team also facilitated design workshops for employees from different Wealth Management.

                    Started in December of 2017, <i>Xperience First</i> was relatively unknown within RBC at the start of my internship. In order to raise awareness about our team and the services we provided, I iteratively designed and developed an <i>Xperience First</i> website, avaiable for all RBC employees to access through RBC's social platform.
