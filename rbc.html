                Last winter, I was a part of <i>Xperience First</i>, a newly formed design startup within RBC Wealth Management. The team included a total of six UI/UX and product designers (including me), one design strategist, and one design lead. Our goal was to facilitate the adoption of human-centred design into the entirety of WMTS (Wealth Managament Technology & Solutions).

            <div class="content-section">
                Our team was tasked with re-designing the user experience and interface of an internal wire transfer application, as well as the overall process of using said application. Before we could begin re-designing it, we needed to fully understand what the application was used for, how it was used, and existing problems. We conducted twelve interviews with end-users, learning about every touchpoint they go through and their pain points.

                Started in December of 2017, Xperience First was relatively unknown within RBC at the start of my internship. In order to raise awareness about our team and the services we provided, I iteratively designed and developed an Xperience First website, avaiable for all RBC employees to access through RBC's social platform. 
                <br/><br/>
                 It began with simple paper and marker mockups, then moved to HTML prototypes. After discussing possible improvements on the design with my boss, I designed a developed a final website that's still being used today.
