      <div class="content-text">
        I was part of Xperience First (X1), the newly formed design CoE within
        RBC Wealth Management. Our goal was to facilitate the adoption of
        human-centred design into WMTS (Wealth Management Technology &
        Solutions).
      </div>
      <div class="content-text-last">
        I can't explicitly display internal RBC wireframes, prototypes, and
        projects on my portfolio. Instead, I will be summarizing my work and
        learnings during my internship at RBC.
      </div>
      <div class="content-title">Promoting Xperience First</div>
      <div class="content-text-last">
        Established in December 2017, Xperience First was relatively unknown
        within RBC when I began my internship. In order to raise awareness about
        our team and the services we provided, I iteratively designed and
        developed Xperience First's first intranet website, available for all
        RBC employees to access through RBC's internal social platform.
      </div>
      <img class="content-img" src="img/rbc-website.png" />
      <div class="content-text-last">
        It began with simple paper and pen wireframes, then progressed to HTML
        and CSS prototypes. After discussing possible improvements on the design
        with the team, I made some changes and developed a final website.
        Conception to completion of the website was three weeks.
      </div>
      <div class="content-title">Design Workshops + Conferences</div>
      <div class="content-text-last">
        Besides redesigning digital applications and processes, our team also
        facilitated design thinking workshops & conferences for RBC employees.
        The purpose of these events was to teach different teams on how to
        utilize design thinking in their own day-to-day jobs. Designers aren't
        the only ones who can utilize design methods and we wanted to emphasize
        that within RBC.
      </div>
      <img class="content-img" src="img/rbc-x1.png" />
      <div class="content-text-last">
        During these workshops & conferences, we would present a real business
        problem to several cross-disciplinary teams and ask them to come up with
        a solution. We would then guide them through a condensed design sprint
        to get them started. The teams would spend a day experimenting with
        empathy mapping, user ecosystem mapping, client journey mapping, forming
        HMW statements, and ideating. Near the end of the day, each team would
        sketch out their solution. The following day, I would take their
        sketches and rapidly design mockups and a digital prototype.
      </div>
      <img class="content-img" src="img/rbc-workshops.png" />
      <div class="content-text">
        Following this, an end-user would test each of the teams' solution and
        provide feedback. Changes would be made based on the feedback and each
        team would present their final solution to the workshop & conference
        sponsors/stakeholders.
      </div>
      <div class="content-text-last">
        By the end of the workshop/conference, each attendee would leave with
        new problem solving skills that they could apply to their jobs and
        everyday life.
      </div>
      <div class="content-title">Redesigning Wire Transfers (NDA)</div>
      <div class="content-text">
        A major project our team worked on was the redesign of an internal wire
        transfer application. We were responsible for improving the UI, UX, and
        overall process when using said application, as well as ensuring user
        adoption.
      </div>
      <div class="content-text">
        Before redesigning the application, we needed to fully understand its
        purpose, how it was used, and its current problems. We conducted ten
        interviews with end-users, learning about every touch point and pain
        point. Five personas and user journey maps were formed from the
        collected data, establishing empathy with the end-users, and allowing us
        to truly understand the problem space. Additional data was gathered from
        talking with subject matter experts and application specialists.
      </div>
      <div class="content-text">
        <span class="font-bold">Key Insights</span> <br />• &nbspThe current
        payments process was highly manual: everal manual touch points were
        required for each and every transaction <br />• &nbspMultiple quality
        checks and reworks were required to mitigate risks
      </div>
      <div class="content-text">
        We formed a HMW statement and several benchmarks for the future state
        regarding risk reduction, efficiency, and the overall experience. These
        benchmarks were formed from end-users' expectations of future features
        (ex. simplified screens, improved UI navigation, single sign-on, etc.).
      </div>
      <div class="content-text">
        Now with a much stronger understanding of the problem and application,
        we began the redesign. Over the course of a two-day workshop with
        end-users and stakeholders, we rapidly designed mockups and put together
        a high-fidelity prototype. The prototype was usability tested with six
        end-users who provided feedback accordingly.
      </div>
      <div class="content-text">
        <span class="font-bold">Key Insights</span> <br />• &nbspAuto-populated
        fields were highly valuable to save time, reduce cognitive load, and
        check for accurate information<br />• &nbsp Users desired a way to keep
        records on file, easily retrieve order details, and easily share details
        with relevant stakeholders <br />• &nbspLabeling needed to be more
        specific and provide more context
      </div>
      <div class="content-text-final">
        Using this information and considering stakeholder opinions of the
        prototype, we made several design changes. After iterating, we now had a
        minimum viable product which was tested once again, this time with eight
        end-users. The results, observations, and top findings from the
        usability testing sessions were consolidated into a report and presented
        to the stakeholders. Once the project was approved, it was handed off
        for development.
