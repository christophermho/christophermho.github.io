                    Last winter, I was a part of <i>Xperience First</i>, the newly formed design team within RBC Wealth Management. The team included a total of four UI/UX and product designers (including me), one design strategist, and one design lead. Our goal was to facilitate the adoption of human-centred design into the entirety of WMTS (Wealth Managament Technology & Solutions).

                    Our team was tasked with redesigning the user experience and interface of an internal wire transfer application, as well as the overall process when using said application. Before we could begin redesigning it, we needed to fully understand what the application was used for, how it was used, and its current problems. We conducted twelve interviews with end-users, learning about each and every touchpoint they go through during their day as well as their pain points.

                    Besides redesigning digital applications and processes, our team also facilitated design thinking workshops for Wealth Management employees, like .

                    Started in December of 2017, <i>Xperience First</i> was relatively unknown within RBC when I began my internship.
