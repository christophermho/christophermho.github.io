      <div class="content-text">
        I was part of Xperience First, the new design CoE within RBC Wealth
        Management. Our goal was to facilitate the adoption of human-centred
        design into Wealth Management Technology & Solutions.

      <div class="content-text-last">
        Due to an NDA, I'm not allowed to display mockups, prototypes, and
        designs I worked on regarding internal RBC projects. Instead, I will be
        summarizing my work and learnings during my internship.

      <div class="content-title font-bold">Promoting Xperience First</div>
      <div class="content-text-last">
        Established in December 2017, Xperience First was relatively unknown
        within RBC when I began my internship. To raise awareness about our team
        and the services we provided, I designed and developed Xperience First's
        first intranet site, available for all RBC employees to view through
        RBC's social platform. It began with simple paper and pen wireframes,
        then progressed to mockups, and finally to HTML/CSS.

      <div class="content-title font-bold">Wire Transfer Redesign (NDA)</div>
      <div class="content-text">
        A major product our team worked on was the redesign of an internal wire
        transfer application. We were responsible for improving the UI/UX, and
        overall process, as well as ensuring user adoption.
      </div>
      <div class="content-text">
        To start, we needed to fully understand the application's purpose, how
        it was used, and its current problems. We conducted ten interviews with
        end-users, learning about every touch point and pain point. Five
        personas and user journey maps were formed from the collected data,
        establishing empathy, and allowing us to truly understand the problem
        space. Additional information was gathered from talking with subject
        matter experts and application specialists.

      <ul class="content-text content-highlight-rbc">
        <span class="font-bold">Key Insights</span>
        <li class="bullet-point">
          The current payments process was highly tedious
        </li>
        <li class="bullet-point">
          Several manual touch points were required for every transaction
        </li>
        <li class="bullet-point">
          Multiple quality checks and reworks were required to mitigate risks
        </li>
      </ul>
      <div class="content-text">
        Multiple benchmarks for the future state regarding risk reduction,
        efficiency, and the overall user experience were formed from end-users'
        expectations of future features (ex. simplified screens, improved UI
        navigation, single sign-on, etc).
      </div>
      <div class="content-text">
        The redesign began by conducting a two-day workshop with end-users and
        stakeholders. We rapidly designed mockups and put together a
        high-fidelity prototype that was usability tested with six end-users who
        provided feedback accordingly.
      </div>
      <ul class="content-text content-highlight-rbc">
        <span class="font-bold">Key Insights</span>
        <li class="bullet-point">
          Auto-populated fields were valuable for saving time, reducing
          cognitive load, and checking accuracy
        </li>
        <li class="bullet-point">
          Users desired easy ways to keep file records, retrieve order details,
          and share details with stakeholders
        </li>
        <li class="bullet-point">
          Labels needed to be more specific and provide more context
        </li>
      </ul>
      <div class="content-text-last">
        Considering this data as well as stakeholder opinions of the prototype,
        several design changes were made. After iterating, the solution was
        usability tested once again. The results, observations, and top findings
        from the tests were consolidated into a report and presented to the
        stakeholders. Once the product was approved, it was handed off for
        development.
      </div>
      <div class="content-title font-bold">Design Thinking Workshops</div>
      <div class="content-text-last">
        Besides designing digital applications, our team also facilitated design
        thinking workshops for RBC employees. The goal was to teach
        multidisciplinary teams how to utilize design thinking in their own
        jobs. Designers aren't the only ones who can utilize design methods and
        we wanted to emphasize that.
      </div>
      <img class="content-img" src="img/rbc-x1.png" />
      <div class="content-text-last">
        During these workshops, we would present a real business problem to
        several teams and ask them to create a solution. To get them started, we
        would guide them through a condensed design sprint. The teams would
        spend a day experimenting with empathy mapping, user eco-system mapping,
        client journey mapping, forming HMW statements, and ideating. Each team
        would sketch their solution as wireframes and I would rapidly design
        mockups and a prototype accordingly.
      </div>
      <img class="content-img" src="img/rbc-workshops.png" />
      <div class="content-text-final">
        Following this, an end-user would usability test each solution and
        provide feedback. Changes would be made accordingly and each team would
        present their solution to the workshop sponsors/stakeholders. By the
        end, each attendee would leave with new problem solving skills that they
        could apply to their jobs.
